This repository contains all the assignments completed as part of the Operating Systems Laboratory during my 5th semester. The assignments are implemented primarily using Shell Scripting and C programs, focusing on the fundamental concepts of operating systems.

📂 Contents

Shell Scripts (.sh) – Programs for process management, file handling, scheduling, memory management, and basic system utilities.

C Programs (.c) – Low-level OS concepts such as process creation, inter-process communication, synchronization, and system calls.

Documentation – Each program is well-commented and includes explanations of logic, usage, and expected output.

⚡ Features

Covers core OS concepts with practical implementations.

Focuses on hands-on learning of UNIX/Linux shell scripting.

Error handling included in scripts for robust execution.

Compatible with most Linux-based environments (tested on Ubuntu).

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/os-lab-assignments.git
cd os-lab-assignments


For shell scripts:

chmod +x filename.sh
./filename.sh


For C programs:

gcc program.c -o program
./program

📝 Notes

Some programs may require bc or other utilities installed in your Linux system.

The assignments are meant for academic purposes, but they can also serve as a reference repository for anyone learning shell scripting or OS fundamentals.
